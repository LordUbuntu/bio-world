# BIO WORLD

Made by Jacobus Burger (2023) for the ASCII Game Jam 2023.

An ASCII game about a rebellious robot fighting to bring organic life to their machine world.
Fight the machine-world and bring the wonder of a bio world to this mechanical one!

## Features

BIOWORLD includes
- 3 interesting bosses
- neat storyline
- straightforward battle system

Not much else, it's a simple game!

## Installation

All you need to play the game is a Python 3 interpreter on your system. From there, simply run `python3 bioworld.py` and the game will go!

## Lessons Learned

I should have begun with a design instead of figuring it out as I went.
I did well to avoid scope-creep by keeping things simple and features limited.
I learned how to better manage gamestate and the challenges of game balance.
